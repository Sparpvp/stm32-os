# Bare Metal Operating System on STM32
## A Journey into Operating Systems for ARM
This project was created to deepen my understanding of
operating system design, particularly on microcontrollers.

Feel free to use, modify or adapt it for your own studies or experimentation.

## Features
- Built completely from scratch
- Preemptive Task Scheduling and Context Switching
- Basic Shell working on USART
- Custom Allocator using a FreeList DS
- Core System Calls
- Custom bootloader routine
- Flexible interrupt handling
- Hardware interaction with peripherals (RCC, GPIO...)

## Great studying resources
